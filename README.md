Overview
========
My dotfiles. Sloppily put together, taking random pieces from various other public dotfiles, but it works. This is more for my own use than anything.

Installation
============
Change default shell to ZSH:

    chsh -s `which zsh`

Use colemak bindings for less/more/man:

    lesskey

Edit the email and token values in `.gitconfig` with the followinj commands:

    git config --global user.email YOUR_EMAIL
    git config --global github.token YOUR_TOKEN

That's it!
